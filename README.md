# Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Classifier ü¶†

A deep learning project to classify chest X-ray images as "Normal" or "Pneumonia" using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with transfer learning. This project is deployed as an interactive web application with Streamlit.

!

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Transfer Learning**: Uses a pre-trained **VGG16** model, known for its simplicity and effectiveness as a feature extractor.
* **Streamlit Web App**: A user-friendly interface for uploading images and getting instant predictions.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated with a focus on **recall**, which is a critical metric for medical diagnoses to minimize false negatives (missed cases of pneumonia).
* **Data Augmentation**: Enhances the model's robustness by generating diverse training data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* A local copy of the dataset (e.g., from Kaggle).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RiteshPx/X_ray_prediction_Pneumonia.git
    cd X_ray_prediction_Pneumonia
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The required Python libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the App Locally

To start the Streamlit web application on your local machine, run the following command from the project's root directory:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
````

This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìÅ Project Structure

  * `app.py`: The main Streamlit web app script.
  * `train_model.py`: Script for training the model, generating plots, and evaluating performance.
  * `pneumonia_classifier_model.h5`: The trained model file (must be present in the same directory as `app.py`).
  * `requirements.txt`: The list of all project dependencies.

## üìà Model Performance

The model's performance was evaluated on a held-out test set. For a medical application, **Recall** is prioritized to ensure the model catches as many true pneumonia cases as possible, as a false negative has a high cost.
